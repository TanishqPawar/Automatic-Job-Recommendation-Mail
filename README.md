# Automatic-Job-Recommendation-Mail
This project is a Freelancer Job Recommendation Platform designed to match freelancers with job opportunities based on their skills. Built using ReactJS for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend, the system allows freelancers to register, update their profiles, and receive personalized job recommendations. Employers can post jobs specifying the required skills, experience, and other relevant details.

The platform includes an AI-based recommendation algorithm that automatically matches freelancers with job posts based on skill similarity. When a new job is posted, the system checks for freelancers whose registered skills match the job's key requirements. If a match is found, an email notification is automatically sent to the freelancer informing them of the new opportunity.

Key features include:

User Authentication: Freelancers can register and log in securely.
Job Posting: Employers can add jobs with detailed information.
Skill Matching: An AI algorithm automatically matches jobs with freelancers’ skills.
Email Notifications: Freelancers receive emails when a job that matches their skills is posted.
Real-time Matching: The system continuously checks for new jobs and sends updates without user intervention.
The project utilizes Nodemailer for sending emails, Express.js for routing, and Mongoose for modeling the MongoDB data. It’s a full-stack application that combines user-friendly frontend interfaces with powerful backend logic to streamline the job matching process for freelancers.
